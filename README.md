## Hi, I'm Ahmad üëã

- ‚öôÔ∏è Aspiring Data Engineer
- üè´ Data Science and Analytics MSc from Brunel University
- ‚öΩ Big football fan

After completing my bachelor's degree in Accounting and Finance with Mandarin and working in the field for about three years, I realized that I needed a change. While I enjoyed the work, I found that it wasn't as mentally stimulating or challenging as I wanted it to be.

That's when I decided to pursue a master's degree in Data Science and Analytics. This was an exciting new field for me, and I was eager to learn more about how data could be used to solve complex problems and drive business decisions. During my studies, I gained hands-on experience with a variety of tools and techniques for data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

Now, I'm looking to take my career to the next level by becoming a data engineer. I'm excited about the prospect of working with big data systems and designing solutions that can help organizations make better use of their data. I believe that my combination of accounting expertise and data science skills gives me a unique perspective on this field, and I'm eager to apply my knowledge to new challenges and opportunities.
